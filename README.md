# code-refactor
This is an example where the client had asked for their website to be updated to have more accesible features. This was to encourage their website being promoted by search engines as well as support a broader range of their consumers. In order to do this, "alt" codes were inserted onto all images, div codes were changed to more appropirate html symantics and the css file was optimised to better accomidate these chages and maintain the websites oringinal image.
